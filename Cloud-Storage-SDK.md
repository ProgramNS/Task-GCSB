Create a bucket
In the Cloud Console, go to Navigation menu > Cloud Storage > Buckets. Click CREATE BUCKET.

Name your bucket: Enter a unique name for your bucket.

Bucket naming rules:
Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.
Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require verification.
Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".
Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.
**Click CONTINUE.**

Set Location type to Multi-region.
Set Location to us (multiple regions in United States)
Click CONTINUE.
Set Default Storage class to Standard.
**Click CONTINUE.**
If needed, uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket under Prevent public access.
Select Fine-grained under Access Control.
Click CONTINUE.
Scroll to the bottom and click CREATE.
That's it â€” you've just created a Cloud Storage bucket!
Note: If the bucket name is already taken, either by you or someone else, the command returns:

Create a Cloud Storage bucket.


Task 1. Upload an object into your bucket
Use Cloud Shell to upload an object into a bucket.

To download this image (ada.jpg) into your bucket, enter this command into Cloud Shell:

curl https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg/800px-Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg --output ada.jpg
Copied!
Use the gsutil cp command to upload the image from the location where you saved it to the bucket you created:

gsutil cp ada.jpg gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME
Copied!
Note: When typing your bucket name, you can use the tab key to autocomplete it.
You can see the image load into your bucket from the command line. You've just stored an object in your bucket!

Now remove the downloaded image:

rm ada.jpg
Copied!
Task 2. Download an object from your bucket
Use the gsutil cp command to download the image you stored in your bucket to Cloud Shell:

gsutil cp -r gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg .
Copied!
If successful, the command returns:

Copying gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg...
/ [1 files][299.6 KiB/299.6 KiB]
Operation completed over 1 objects/299.6 KiB.
You've just downloaded the image from your bucket.

Task 3. Copy an object to a folder in the bucket
Use the gsutil cp command to create a folder called image-folder and copy the image (ada.jpg) into it:

gsutil cp gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/image-folder/
Copied!
Note: Compared to local file systems, folders in Cloud Storage have limitations, but many of the same operations are supported.
If successful, the command returns:

Copying gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg [Content-Type=image/png]...
- [1 files] [ 299.6 KiB/ 299.6 KiB]
Operation completed over 1 objects/299.6 KiB
The image file has been copied into a new folder in your bucket.

Test completed task
Click Check my progress to verify your performed task. If you have successfully uploaded an object into a folder in your Cloud Storage bucket, you'll see an assessment score.

Copy an object to a folder in the bucket (ada.jpg).
Task 4. List contents of a bucket or folder
Use the gsutil ls command to list the contents of the bucket:

gsutil ls gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME
Copied!
If successful, the command returns a message similar to:

gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/image-folder/
That's everything currently in your bucket.

Task 5. List details for an object
Use the gsutil ls command, with the -l flag to get some details about the image file you uploaded to your bucket:

gsutil ls -l gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
Copied!
If successful, the command returns a message similar to:

306768  2017-12-26T16:07:570Z  gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
TOTAL: 1 objects, 30678 bytes (299.58 KiB)
Now you know the image's size and date of creation.

Task 6. Make your object publicly accessible
Use the gsutil acl ch command to grant all users read permission for the object stored in your bucket:

gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
Copied!
If successful, the command returns:

Updated ACL on gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
Your image is now public, and can be made available to anyone.

You should see your image with the Public link box. Click the Copy URL and open the URL in a new browser tab.

Note: Who are you looking at? This is Ada Lovelace, credited with being the first computer programmer. She worked with mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage, who proposed the Analytical Engine.

Her interest in the Analytical Engine lead to translating a paper on the machine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea, adding her own extensive annotations. These notes are considered the first computer program - an algorithm designed to be carried out by the machine. She developed a vision of the capability of computers, going beyond number crunching, and examined how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.
